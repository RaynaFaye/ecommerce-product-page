# E-commerce product page - Frontend Mentor

Front-end coding challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
